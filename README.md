## Brand Guidelines (eventually relocate this):

### Typography:

Typography should be simple and not take away from other visuals.

We use Lato, Helvetica, Arial.

For now, we use whatever size/weight, though this will change shortly.

City of Ann Arbor's font size: p: 1rem, minor interactible text (footer, nav): .875rem, major interactible text (buttons, main content): 1.125rem, h1: 3.5rem, h2: 2.5rem, h3: 2rem, 

### Colors:

We have several choices we could go for with colors:

- Steal the University of Michigan's colors

We won't do this so we don't associate too closely to the college.

- Steal Ann Arbor's colors (primary: 0b9a6d, secondary: 18453b, tertiary: ceebe2, grey1: 222, grey2: 333, button-primary: 0787ad, button-secondary: 0b9a6d) 

This would more closely associate us with Ann Arbor and the area.

- Create our own palette

We could branch off of Ann Arbor's palette to better brand ourselves.

### Spacing:

Nothing too defined for now. Keep the page open by minimizing text. Replace text with simple icons where possible. Prefer shadowing to outlines or contrasts to give a better look and feel.
